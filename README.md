# üìö Library Management System

This is a full-stack **Library Management System**, developed as a capstone project for the **Patika+ Frontend Web Developer Program**. It allows users to manage books, borrowers, authors, categories, publishers, and borrowing transactions. The backend API is built with **Spring Boot**, while the frontend is developed using **React**.
