# üìö Library Management System

This is a full-stack **Library Management System**, developed as a capstone project for the Patika+ Frontend Web Developer Program. The system allows users to manage books, borrowers, authors, categories, publishers, and borrowing transactions. The backend API is built with **Spring Boot**, while the frontend interface is developed using **React**.

## üåê Live Demo
- **Backend**: [Library App Backend](https://github.com/Yldrmceyy/LibraryAppSpringBoot)
- **Frontend**: [Library App Frontend](https://github.com/Yldrmceyy/LibraryAppReact)

## üöÄ Features

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** or **yarn** installed
- **Java JDK** installed
- **Maven** installed
- **PostgreSQL** database up and running

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Modal System**: Custom modal for error handling (no `window.alert` used)
- **CSS Framework**: CSS, Material UI
- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state and lifecycle management.

## üìö Usage
Upon launching the application, you'll be able to navigate through the following pages:

- **Login Page**: Users can authenticate themselves here.
- **Publishers Page**: List, add, edit, or delete publishers.
- **Categories Page**: Manage book categories with full CRUD functionality.
- **Books Page**: View, add, edit, or delete books from the library.
